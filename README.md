Follow-up explorations using the jester package
Here I have tried eos n,p,e as direct parameters. I unabled to upload full folder but the changes are only made in eos_tov and automatic_differentiation file. You can check it. The problem i am facing is in the 1st iteration it gives NaNs values. If possible check it in your free time. I also try to find out the solution to this error.
